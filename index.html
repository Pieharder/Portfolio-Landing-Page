          <p>I have worked in Emergency Medical Services for the past 6 years which has allowed and helped me to
            cultivate and develop creative problem solving skills, ability to work well with others and adapt to an ever
            changing enviroment. I have enjoyed my time in EMS but find myself ready for a change and have begun to
            navigate into the computer science field with Epicodus!</p>

            <h3><span style="text-align: center;">Travel</span></h3>
            <p>I love to travel. Seeing the world, learning about and experiencing different cultures from around the
              globe. I feel this serves to expand my knowledge and understanding, allowing me to better work with and
              around people.</p>

          <div class=col-md-4>
            <h3><span style="text-align: center;">Teamwork</span></h3>
            <p>As I said before working in EMS forces you to work very closely with your partner as well as police and
              fire services. It teaches the skills to know when to take the lead and do what needs to be done and at the
              same time to know when to step back and allow for input and assistance from others.</p>
